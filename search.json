[{"title":"倦怠社会","path":"/2024/04/19/倦怠社会/","content":"Author: 韩炳哲Summary: 现代功绩社会主体心理的映照Type: Article 开篇，作者指出神话故事里的普罗米修斯，就是倦怠社会里自我剥削式主体最初的隐喻。 古希腊神话中，普罗米修斯因为帮人类盗取火种，而被罚绑在山崖。宙斯每天派秃鹰白天啄食他肝脏，夜晚他又重新长出肝脏，这样普罗米修斯就承受着一种日复一日永无止境的折磨，被一种类似倦怠感的痛苦控制。 作者认为这就是现代功绩社会主体心理的映照：自身对自身施加暴力。 《倦怠社会》里所言“暴力不仅源于否定性，也源于肯定性；不仅来自他者或外来者，还来自同类。”这种自我施暴的剥削十分隐蔽。就像没人会责怪抖音的推送太过有趣，只会反思自己没有自制能力。我们可以反抗他人的压迫，却没法抵挡自我的“剥削”；我们以为自己可以在功成名就后退隐山林，实际上却早已在资本的裹挟下面目全非。 作者认为，过去人们处于传统的规训社会。在规训社会里，社会存在种种规定和禁令，给人们的自由带来很多束缚和限制。但也因为有规定的存在，社会剥削是存在边界的。 “21世纪的社会不再是一个规训社会，而是功绩社会。其中的成员也不再是驯化的主体，而是功绩主体。” 随着社会发展，人们进入了功绩社会。在功绩社会里，人们不再受外在的强权机构控制，也没有外力强迫剥削个人。 “但是摆脱了强权机构控制后，人们并没有导向自由，因为自由和约束几乎在同一时刻降临。”——原文摘抄 功绩社会里，人们投身于一种自我约束中，以达到“功绩”的最大化。当追求“功绩”日益严重时，自我约束发展成为了一种自我剥削。 “因为自我剥削伴随着一种自由的感觉。功绩主体不断剥削自我，直至精力枯竭。他发展出一种自我攻击，并往往以自我毁灭为终结。”——原文摘抄 外在的约束尚有边界，而这种自我的约束是360度全方位、无尽无边的。在功绩社会，自我剥削比他者剥削更有效率。功绩社会的一代人，终日伴随着疲劳、抑郁、不可摆脱的倦怠感。 简而言之，社会从资本家强迫劳动者、剥削劳动者的社会，变成了我们自愿自动压迫和剥削自己的社会。 凯恩斯预测大家有一天都会达到小康状态，从而感到满足，因为新增的收入会越来越没有意义，大家就不再追求更多的东西。然而现状，大家都看到了：宁愿卷死自己，也要累死他人才是常态。 功绩社会，大家都努力，你不努力就容易出现自我否定。但在不停的努力中，必然会出现倦怠。 超过一定经济水平以后，人们大部分的金钱，都用于购买从绝对意义上并不真正需要的东西，但拥有这些东西意味着快乐、优越感、自我感觉良好。用一个网红的词语大概是：炫耀性消费。 但普通大众是无法克服人性的，每个人都是在跟别人的比较中，定位自身，形成自我身份认证的。 作者韩炳哲认为现代互联网科技发展，以“点赞文化”为代表加速了功绩社会的发展。 互联网科技带来了过度的刺激、信息和资讯，从根本上改变了人们注意力的结构和运作方式。 人们的感知因为过多的信息变得分散，反过来影响时间管理方式——习惯多工作业。但这种多工作业方式并不是人类新掌握的技能，代表文明进步，确切说反而是一种倒退。这种过度刺激，会带来过度的“积极性”，刺激人们更多地去自我剥削。 随着生产力发展，自我剥削日益加剧，让工作和生活失去了目的和意义，生成难以克服的倦怠感。 “提高或者降低工作速度，并不能解决当下的危机，我们需要一种全新的生活心态，把我们从飞转的停滞状态中解救出来。”——原文摘抄 现代社会是一种强制的自由，即我们处于拥有自由的假象和幻影中。书本里称21世纪的社会是功绩社会，而我们则是功绩主体，相比于规训社会里的规训主体，功绩主体无须屈从任何人，或者说只屈从于自身，但尽管摆脱了统治机构，却没有导向自由，自由和约束几乎在同一时刻降临。 “一个人同时是囚犯和看守，受害者和施暴者”这句话是“强制自由”最好的印证。过量的正反馈会导致既定目标的偏离，过度的活跃也会转变为一种过度的消极，我们失去了否定、消极、愤怒以及沉思的能力，“生命在现代变成了生存”。 在我们这个倦怠的社会里面有了一个新的问题，我们绝不允许自己有一丝的无聊。 过度的这种社会的积极性呈现给我们的是一种过度的一种刺激，每天都在刺激我们，大量的信息和资讯。因为我们肯定了自己的这种无限可能了，所以我们需要不断的拓展自己，我们每天开始疯狂的看资讯学习，要突破自己。 于是有个电影台词说的，现代人再也不会留意日落了。 这个留意日落的状态其实它本身就是一种我们理想的一种无聊。 韩敏哲在这里认为，我们涣散的这种注意力，其实反而他并不会产生新的事物了。他只会重复或加速已经存在的事物，我们看似获得了无数的讯息和知识，疯狂的在运转自己。但其实我们把面铺的越广就越不会深入他。你害怕无聊，当5分钟过去了，你感到无聊了，就会马上寻找新的一个替代品。于是短文字短视频就成为我们的这个时代的新欢，他和过去的一生只能做一件事形成了两个极端。 而只有深度的这种注意力才会创造新的文化，这种深度的注意力恰恰来自于一种深度的无聊。 也许到了功绩社会的晚期，人们普遍就会觉醒了。我们下一次的思想革命的对象可能就是推翻剥削自我的那个自我。我们从疲劳的倦怠走向一个亲近世界的倦怠，疲劳的倦怠，使人相互的对立。而亲近世界的倦怠是我们坐在傍晚的湖边从工具的人中走出来，成为自然的人，自我松动，不再向内剥削了，而是向着世界延展。人的心灵回到了群居的时代。","tags":["Read"]},{"title":"Monash IT FIT5037","path":"/2024/04/19/Monash-IT-FIT5037/","content":"FIT5037Week 1: OverviewType of Network Attacks Interruption Availability Interception Confidentiality Modification Integrity Fabrication Authentication Security Goals Secrecy&#x2F; Confidentiality(CONF) Encryption Integrity Message Authentication Code(MAC) Digital Signature Authentication The digital signature, biometrics, password Non-repudiation(NR) The digital signature, biometrics Availability&lt;!–more–&gt; Week2 Cryptography Foundations for Network SecurityBlock cipher: process one input block at a time produce one output block for each input block common block sizes: 64, 128 and 256 bits Stream cipher: process input elements continuously produces one element at a time common element size: 1 bit or 1 byte operation is generally exclusive OR (XOR) between input elements and stream cipher key ECB, CBC,CFB, OFB, CTR RSA is not indistinguishable under chosen-cipher text attack Why are attacks in the IND-CPA model effective against RSA?

Then Bob calculates: Hash(key, “I’m Bob” || nonce). Alice receives the above hash value and recalculates it for verification. Since the hash value is different for each nonce, replay attacks are mitigated.

After verifying Alice’s identity, the trusted entity issues a certificate containing Alice’s name and publickey. Alice sends the entire certificate to Bob. Bob uses Alice’s public key to verify the certificate - ensuring it is from Alice and not someone else. The certificate cannot be forged or tampered with. Core Functions of a CASubject Verification Ensure that the entity applying for a certificate possesses or represents the identity in the subject field. Signing Digital Certificates The CA uses its private key to generate two digital signatures for the certificate. Once the signatures are applied, the certificate cannot be modified. Anyone with the CA’s public key can verify the signatures. Get a Certificate from CA:Step 1: Generate a public&#x2F;private key pair Step 2: Generate a certificate signing request (CSR); Attack Scenario: Genuine CertificateThe attacker forwards a genuine certificate to Alice. Alice recognizes the certificate as genuine, so she encrypts secret with the certificate’s public key andsends it to the “server.” The attacker intercepts the request but cannot decrypt the secret because they do not possess the privatekey. Attack Scenario: Fake CertificateThe attacker forges a certificate for the domain example.com using their own public key. The CA does not sign the certificate as the attacker is not associated with example.com. The attacker attempts to self-sign the certificate and sends it to Alice. Alice’s browser raises a warning as it cannot find any trusted certificate to validate the receivedcertificate. Attack Scenario: Attacker’s CertificateThe attacker possesses a valid certificate of their own. The attacker sends their certificate to Alice. Alice’s browser checks if the subject field of the certificate matches Alice’s intent. The received certificate’s validity is checked. The certificate’s subject (common name) is verified to match the server’s hostname. Attacks Against PKIMan-in-the-Middle Proxy The proxy creates a self-signed CA certificate installed on the user’s browser. The proxy intercepts communications. Attacks on CA Verification Process Attack on CA Signing Process: Private key compromise. How to protect private keys: Use a hardware security model. Attacks on Algorithms: Digital certificates rely on one-way hash and digital signatures. Use stronger algorithms. User Confirmation Attacks: Certain software does not compare the information within the certificate (commonname field) with the user-provided or approved information: Security vulnerability in Common Name. Week 3B: Email Security What are the main services provided by PGP? Key management, confidentiality, integrity, authenticity. What is the purpose of detached signatures? Signatures are sent separately. Two files: the original data and the signature. Why is R64 encoding used for email applications? Some email servers do not accept binary emails and require printable characters. R64 uses ASCIIcharacters, all of which are printable. What is S&#x2F;MIME? What encryption functions does S&#x2F;MIME use? S&#x2F;MIME &#x3D; Secure MIME 3DES&#x2F;AES for encryption, Elgamal for key exchange, SHA for signing What is DKIM? How does DKIM email authentication service differ from S&#x2F;MIME or PGP? The sender’s email server signs the email. DKIM is used for email server to email server communication, while PGP and S&#x2F;MIME are end-to-endencryption. Why is Transport Layer Security (TLS) not sufficient to protect email? Answer: TLS protects communication between two hops; all intermediate hops see plaintext. Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) Text-only Limited to ASCII characters Size limitations Command-only Issues No security - plaintext messages PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) Key management Authentication (AUTH) + Integrity (INT) Digital signatures (No-Repudiation) Confidentiality (CONF) Encryption: Symmetric encryption IDEA, 3DES-EDE, AES Public-key encryption RSA, Elgamal, Digital Signature Algorithm Hash MD5, SHA-1, SHA-2, SHA-512 Encryption steps: HASH(M) &#x3D;&gt; digest RSA(digest, private key) &#x3D;&gt; digital signature sig RSA is a public-key encryption method used for signing. digital signature sig || M &#x3D;&gt; certificate Compress(certificate) &#x3D;&gt; compressed certificate AES(session key, compressed certificate) &#x3D;&gt; encrypted compressed certificate (using symmetricencryption) RSA(session key, recipient’s public key) &#x3D;&gt; encrypt session key for non-peer-to-peer encryption of thesession key Another user can retrieve the session key of 128 bits using their private key Sent to the recipient: encrypted compressed certificate || encrypted session key Decryption steps: Retrieve the decryption session key using the private key &#x3D;&gt; session key Decrypt the compressed certificate using the session key &#x3D;&gt; compressed certificate Obtain M || digital signature by decompressing the data &#x3D;&gt; M || digital signature &#x3D;DeCompress(compressed certificate) Verify Hash(M) and Hash(M’) Hash(M’) &#x3D; Decrypt the digital signature using the sender’s public key. Compression: PGP uses ZIP compression algorithm after applying the signature and before encryption. Why is this order important? Signing: It is best to sign the original message before compression to ensure the signature is based onthe original message. Transmission: Compression saves on email transmission and file storage space. Encryption: Encrypting after compression can enhance encryption because compression reduces redundancy inthe message. Radix-64 Encoding Used for compatibility with email protocols Text &#x3D;&gt; Binary &#x3D;&gt; ASCII characters (every 6 bits &#x3D; 1 ASCII character) Key Management Send Key Identifiers (KeyID) instead of the full public key for bandwidth efficiency. Users can have multiple key pairs. Two types of keyrings need to be maintained: User’s own public&#x2F;private key pairs Store the encrypted private key instead of the plaintext private key. Public keys of other communication partners Store the public keys of other users indexed by their KeyID. Trust Model Does not rely on Certificate Authorities (CAs). Each user is their own CA. Users sign the keys of users they trust, forming a web of trust. If there is a chain of signatures leading to a trusted key, the trusted key is signed by other trusted keys. Restrictions Misuse Leakage No forward secrecy Public key exchange is required. Targeted attacks against PGP KeyID. May hinder useful functionalities such as search, spam filtering, and subject extraction. Lack of non-repudiation and authentication in compromised scenarios. What is S&#x2F;MIME? What encryption functions are used in S&#x2F;MIME? S&#x2F;MIME stands for Secure&#x2F;Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions. Digital Signatures RSA Hash Functions MD5, SHA-1, SHA-2 Session Key Encryption Key Transport: RSA, ElGamal (asymmetric) Key Agreement: Diffie-Hellman (DH) Message Encryption (Symmetric) AES-128 Triple DES (T3-DES) MAC (Message Authentication Code) HMAC with SHA-1 Cipher Modes AES-GCM (Galois Counter Mode) AES-CCM (Counter with CBC-MAC) Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) MIME supports different types of content. X.509 v3 certificates Each client has a trusted CA certificate list. Own key pairs and certificates signed by trusted CAs. DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) Outgoing emails from the sender’s domain must be signed using the sender domain’s secret key before leavingthe domain. Transparent to the user Mail Submission Agent (MSA) signs Mail Delivery Agent (MDA) verifies The recipient can verify the signature using the domain’s public key. The public key is stored in DNS servers, and the signature is attached. What is DKIM? How does DKIM email authentication service differ from S&#x2F;MIME or PGP? DKIM stands for DomainKeys Identified Mail. The sender’s email server signs the email. DKIM is used for authentication between email servers, whereas PGP and S&#x2F;MIME provide end-to-end encryption. Q: Why don’t email service providers deploy end-to-end (user-to-user) email encryption?Encryption prohibits email systems from providing useful functionalities such as filtering, topic extraction,targeting ads, and search. Week4：IPSecVirtual Private Network (VPN) Isolation Tunneling Multiple logical overlay networks coexist on the same physical network, each network providing its ownprivate services. AnswerPlacing the VPN server in front of the firewall is better. VPN also has the functionality of a firewall. Afterthe VPN gateway, the messages will be decrypted, allowing the firewall to inspect the details of the packets. IPsec: Internet Protocol SecurityIPSec is a security protocol used to protect network layer data. It provides security processing at theInternet layer for IP datagrams, protecting them according to the security policies of the communicating IPnodes before forwarding them to the network interface layer. The receiving IP node verifies the datagrams based on established security parameters and rejects those thatare not protected according to the defined policies. The services provided by IPSec include: Authentication, Integrity, Confidentiality, No-Repudiation (butdoes not hide identity). Authentication: Verifies the claimed identity of the data source, ensuring the authenticity of the sender. Integrity: Data Integrity Anti-Replay: It can detect tampering with and duplicate arrival of individual IP datagrams. Confidentiality: Protects data from unauthorized disclosure and provides limited trafficconfidentiality. It hides the source IP address, destination IP address, size of IP datagrams, andcommunication frequency. The entire process of IPsec consists of five steps: Initiation: Something needs to trigger the creation of our tunnel. For example, when we configure IPsec on arouter, we use an access list to tell the router which data to protect. When the router receives content thatmatches the access list, it initiates the IKE process. The tunnel can also be initiated manually. IKE Phase 1: We negotiate a security association to build the IKE Phase 1 tunnel (ISAKMP tunnel). IKE Phase 2: In the IKE Phase 1 tunnel, we build the IKE Phase 2 tunnel (IPsec tunnel). Data Transfer: We send user data through the IKE Phase 2 tunnel to protect the user data. Termination: The IPsec tunnel will terminate after a period of time when there is no user data to beprotected. IPSec has two main protocols: Authentication Header (AH): Integrity Data-Origin Authentication Anti-Replay Access Control No Confidentiality Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP): Integrity Data-Origin Authentication Anti-Replay Confidentiality ESP can provide only confidentiality (CONF), only authentication (AUTH), or both. IPSec has two modes: Encapsulation Mode Transport Mode: Inserts the IPsec header into the IP packet to protect the data. Host-to-host Tunnel Mode: Keeps the original packet and adds a new header. The ESP&#x2F;AH header follows the new IP header, while theoriginal IP packet remains unchanged. Gateway-to-gateway Anti-replay ServicesReplay: AUTH packet Case If the received sequence number is smaller than the size of the current window’s leftmost edge, discard thepacket. If the received sequence number is within the range of the current window, check if the packet has beenreceived. If the received sequence number is greater than the maximum size of the current window, set the receivedsequence number as the maximum edge and calculate the minimum edge using N-W+1. If the recipient sets N&#x3D;60 and window size W&#x3D;64, the range should be 0-60. The IPSec policy file contains a list of entries:3 IPSec Policies: DISCARD Discard the packet. PROTECT Protect the packet using AH and ESP security protocols. BYPASS Bypass IPSec processing. Security Association (SA)SA is a contract between two entities that specifies how they will communicate using security services. Security Association Database (SAD) AH information ESP information SA lifecycle IPSec protocol mode (Transport&#x2F;Tunnel) IPSec Architecture Authentication Header (AH): Extended header for message authentication. Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP): Provides encryption with combined confidentiality and messageintegrity. Internet Key Exchange (IKE): Key management scheme for IPSec. SA establishment: Participants of the IKE protocol first establish security associations to define thesecurity parameters for the IPSec session, such as encryption algorithms, authentication algorithms, keylengths, etc. These parameters will be used for encrypting and authenticating IP packets. Key exchange: IKE uses the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm to negotiate and generate shared keys.Through Diffie-Hellman key exchange, communicating parties can securely generate shared keys without directlytransmitting the keys. Authentication: The IKE protocol supports various authentication methods such as pre-shared keys,digital certificates, Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), etc. Authentication ensures that communicating partiescan mutually verify each other’s identities and prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. Key negotiation and establishment: Through the negotiation process, IKE parties use the Diffie-Hellmankey exchange algorithm to generate shared keys and use these keys to establish various keys required for theIPsec session, such as symmetric keys and asymmetric keys. Anonymising NetworkC. IPsec does not provide anonymity on the Internet. It is primarily used for encrypting and securing thetransmission of data, rather than hiding or anonymizing the identities of senders or receivers. Solution: decentralized, anonymous network A. When using Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP), it provides confidentiality. ESP is part of the IPsecprotocol suite and is used to provide encryption and authentication of data over IP networks. B. IPsec provides anti-replay properties, meaning it can prevent attackers from replaying captured packets,thus protecting the integrity and security of the communication. D. When using Authentication Header (AH), IPsec provides integrity. AH is also part of the IPsec protocolsuite, and it provides integrity and authentication of data but does not provide encryption. No CONF TOR Distributed Anonymous Communication ServiceThe sender must negotiate an encryption key with each router. Components of Tor Client Server Tor (Onion) router: Special proxy relays application data. Directory server: Provides Tor router information. Process The last router sees the plaintext data but doesn’t know where the message originated from. Each router only knows its predecessor and successor. Process of a client sending a message: The client retrieves the Tor node list from the directory server. The client randomly selects a path to the destination server. The client negotiates an AES key with each router (each router has its own encryption key). The client encrypts the message: C3 &#x3D; Encrypt(K3, data||IP_Server) C2 &#x3D; Encrypt(K2, C3 || IP_OR3) C1 &#x3D; Encrypt(K1, C2 || IP_OR2) The client sends an IP packet: IP_Client || IP_OR1 || C1 Packet processing at each router: Packet arrives at OR1: C2 || IP_OR2 &#x3D; DEC(K1, C1) Cache IP_Client, IP_OR2 Send an IP packet: IP_OR1 || IP_OR2 || C2 Packet arrives at OR2: C3 || IP_OR3 &#x3D; DEC(K2, C2) Cache IP_OR1 || IP_OR3 Send an IP packet: IP_OR2 || IP_OR3 || C3 Packet arrives at OR3: IP_Server || data &#x3D; DEC(K3, C3) Cache IP_OR2, IP_Server Send an IP packet: IP_OR3 || IP_SERVER || data Week5A：FirewallRequirements of a firewall All the traffic between trust zones should pass through the firewall. Only authorized traffic, as defined by the security policy, should be allowed to pass through. The firewall itself must be immune to penetration, which implies using a hardened system with securedOperating Systems. Determines the direction in which requests may be initiated and are allowed to flow through the firewall. Ittells whether the traffic is “inbound” (From the network to the firewall) or vice-versa “outbound” Firewall Policy• User control: Controls access to the data based on the role of the user who is attempting to access it. Applied to usersinside the firewall perimeter.• Service control: Controls access by the type of service offered by the host. Applied on the basis of network address, theprotocol of connection and port numbers.• Direction control: Determines the direction in which requests may be initiated and are allowed to flow through the firewall. Ittells whether the traffic is “inbound” (From the network to firewall) or vice-versa “outbound” Firewall actions• Accepted: Allowed to enter the connected network&#x2F;host through the firewall.• Denied: Not permitted to enter the other side of firewall.• Rejected: Similar to “Denied”, but tells the source about this decision through ICMP packet. three types of firewalls:• Packet Filter Firewall• Stateful Firewall• Application&#x2F;Proxy Firewall Overview of TLSTransport Layer Security (TLS) provides a secure channel between two communicating applications. Integrity: Channel can detect any changes made to the data during transmission Authentication: At least one end of the channel needs to be authenticated, so the other end knows who itis talking to. Confidentiality: Nobody other than the two ends of the channel can see the actual content of the datatransmitted. TLS Layer • TLS sits between the Transport &amp; Application layer• Unprotected data is given to TLS by the Application layer• TLS handles encryption, decryption, and integrity check• TLS gives protected data to the Transport layer TLS HandshakeBefore a client and server can communicate securely, several things need to be set up first: Encryption algorithm and key MAC algorithm Algorithm for key exchange Data is transferred using records:fragmentation: ≤ 16KB Each record contains a header and a payload. Padding Oracle Attack The goal of a padding oracle attack is to compromise the confidentiality of encrypted data, especially in caseswhere block cipher modes (such as CBC mode) are used for encryption. In this mode, the plaintext data is divided into fixed-sized blocks and transmitted after encryption using akey. Each encrypted block is encrypted using the ciphertext of the previous block as the initialization vector(IV). The steps of a padding oracle attack are as follows: The attacker intercepts the encrypted ciphertext and selects a specific encrypted block to attack. The attacker modifies the last byte of that encrypted block and sends the modified ciphertext back to thedecrypting entity. When the decrypting entity attempts to decrypt the modified ciphertext, if the padding verification stepfails (for example, if the format of the padding bytes is incorrect), the decrypting entity will return anerror, indicating a padding verification failure. The attacker leverages the result of the padding verification failure to infer the true value of the lastbyte of the modified ciphertext block. This is because the padding verification step provides information aboutthe correctness of the padding bytes’ format. By continuously modifying the padding bytes until the paddingverification succeeds, the attacker can deduce the correct value of the padding bytes. By repeating the above steps byte by byte, the attacker can deduce the value of each byte in the encryptedblock in sequence. Countermeasures Remove server responses Use AES GCM model - authenticated encryption Ensure that the ciphertext is not modified during the transmission Week 5:Wireless NetworkWireless Network Security Overview and Countermeasures Wireless networks face various security threats, but there are countermeasures to mitigate these risks. The basic elements of the IEEE 802.11 wireless security standard include WEP (insecure), WPA, and WPA2. Understanding the vulnerabilities in the implementation of WPA2 and analyzing the unique threats posed byphysical layer interference attacks. Wireless Security: The Problem Channel: Broadcast nature makes it easier for eavesdropping and interference. Mobility and Accessibility: Mobile devices are more susceptible to threats. Resources: Limited memory&#x2F;power makes it challenging to implement robust security systems. The MAC address (Media Access Control Address) is a unique identifier for network interfaces used to identifydevices on a local network. However, MAC address-based authentication can be bypassed because MAC addresses canbe spoofed or forged. Attackers can use specific software or tools to modify their device’s MAC address, masquerading as a trusteddevice. This deception allows attackers to bypass MAC address-based authentication measures and gainunauthorized network access. Therefore, although the MAC address serves as a unique identifier for a device, it is not a reliableauthentication mechanism as it can be tampered with or forged. In wireless networks, higher-levelauthentication methods such as WPA&#x2F;WPA2 passwords, enterprise-level 802.1X authentication, etc., are typicallyrequired for stronger security. Threat： Man-in-the-Middle attack Identity theft, media access control(MAC) address spoofing Ad hoc networks Denial of Service(DoS) Network injection Wireless Security Measures Securing transmissions: signal-hiding: to protect the location of access points encryption Securing access points authentication JammingThe adversary interferes with the reception of messages by transmitting a continuous jamming signal, or severalshort jamming pulses. cause DoS Detection: monitor signal strength monitor carrier sensing time Week6：Network AttacksSecurity of WEP in IEEE 802.11b: Encryption Algorithm: WEP uses RC4 to encrypt data. RC4 is a stream cipher algorithm used to generateciphertext by XORing plaintext with a key. Key Management: WEP uses a fixed key for encryption, typically a 40-bit or 104-bit key. The key needs to beshared between the wireless access point and wireless clients. Insecurity Improved IV Management: Detection of IV reuse IV collisions WEP Recommendations: Changing IV for each data packet Some weak implementations of WEP Message modification without knowledge of the key Insecurity INT CRC32 is not a MAC: It is linear CRC32 used with stream cipher: Stream ciphers are linear Modification of ciphertext possible without disclosing m Insecurity of WEP in IEEE 802.11b: Key Weakness: WEP uses a relatively small key space of 40 bits or 104 bits, making it vulnerable toexhaustive attacks. Attackers can attempt all possible key combinations to break WEP encryption. Initialization Vector (IV) Reuse: WEP uses a 24-bit IV to increase encryption strength. However, WEP repeatsthe same IV in practical use, leading to repetitiveness in encrypted traffic, allowing attackers to retrievethe encryption key. Weaknesses in the RC4 Algorithm: The RC4 algorithm used by WEP has certain weaknesses that enable attackersto recover the key by analyzing the encrypted data stream. This type of attack is known as WEP key recoveryattack. Data Integrity Issues: WEP does not provide a mechanism for data integrity checks, which means attackers cantamper with the data without being detected. Key Management and Authentication Issues: WEP employs weak key management and authentication mechanisms,making it susceptible to dictionary attacks and forged authentication attacks. Security of WPA TKIP in IEEE 802.11gTemporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) Key Mixing: IV and key are mixed before RC4 encryption for each packet. Protection against replay attacks using sequence counter. Message Integrity Check (MIC) instead of CRC32 for data integrity. Rekeying: Unique key for each packet. Security of WPA2 CCMP in IEEE 802.11i Authentication: Verifying the identity of users or devices. Confidentiality: Protecting data from being intercepted during transmission by encrypting it. Integrity: Ensuring that data is not tampered with during transmission using checksums and MessageAuthentication Codes (MAC). Difference between TKIP and CCMP: TKIP was introduced to enhance the security of WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy). It provides encryption,integrity, and message authentication but is relatively weaker. CCMP is the encryption protocol used in WPA2, providing authentication, integrity, and confidentiality. It ismore secure than TKIP. WPA2 (PSK): Password Cracking Attack The attacker starts by monitoring the wireless network (using tools like Wireshark). The attacker identifies connected users on the WiFi (can be discovered using Wireshark). The attacker forges a de-auth packet and forces the victim user to disconnect from the WiFi. When the user reconnects to the WiFi, the attacker captures the handshake containing the PSK hash value. The attacker offline cracks the hash and recovers the password. WPA2: Security Best Practices Avoid WPA2 PSK. Use EAP-TLS certificate-based authentication. Implement rogue access point detection. Use the latest operating system. Network Layer: Lower Layers VPN (Virtual Private Network) and IPSEC (Internet Protocol Security): VPN and IPSEC are excellent when you want to encrypt all network traffic. Transport Layer: TLS (Transport Layer Security): Services provided: Confidentiality: Protects data from being intercepted during transmission through encryption. Encryption: Data is encrypted using cryptographic algorithms, ensuring only authorized parties can decrypt it. - Integrity: Ensures data is not tampered with during transmission through checksums and MessageAuthentication Codes (MAC). - Message Authentication Code (MAC): Used to verify the integrity and authenticity of messages. - Authentication: Verifies the identity of communicating parties through methods like digitalcertificates. Application Layer: SYN Flood Attack: SYN flood attacks exploit vulnerabilities in the TCP three-way handshake process. Attackers continuouslysend a large number of forged SYN packets to servers, depleting the server’s Transmission Control Block (TCB)queue resources. Countermeasure: SYN Cookie Upon receiving a SYN packet, the server calculates a keyed hash using a key derived from the SYN packet. The hash value (H), known as the SYN cookie, is sent to the client (IP address) as the initial sequence number. - The server does not store half-open connections in its queue. - Since the attacker receives a fake IP address, they won’t receive H. - Legitimate clients send H+1 to the server, which the server verifies.2. TCP RST Attack: - TCP RST attacks involve immediately terminating a connection between two hosts by sending RST packets. - TLS cannot prevent TCP RST attacks since TLS operates above TCP and cannot protect the TCP header,allowing the RST flag to be set. - Solution: Use Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) to detect and prevent TCP RST attacks.3. TCP Session Hijacking Attack: - Hackers can execute TCP session hijacking attacks by capturing packets and manipulating the next sequencenumber and acknowledgement number. - Solution: - Make it difficult to spoof packets by randomizing initial sequence numbers and source port numbers. - Encrypt the TCP payload. DNS Protocol: Authoritative Name Server (Domain Name System): Each DNS zone has at least one authoritative name server responsible for publishing information aboutthat zone and providing authoritative and deterministic responses to DNS queries. Local DNS Cache Poisoning Attack: Attack against user machines: Attackers send forged DNS responses with malicious IP addresses to usermachines that send DNS queries. Attack against local DNS servers (cache poisoning attack): Attackers send forged responses to local DNSservers while they perform iterative queries to DNS servers on the Internet, as long as they arrive before theactual responses. Remote DNS Cache Poisoning Attack: Remote DNS cache poisoning attack requires guessing port numbers, transaction IDs, etc. Cache impact: If no attempts fail, the actual response will be cached by the local DNS server, and theattacker needs to wait for cache timeout to make the next attempt. Countermeasures: DNSSEC (DNS Security Extensions): DNSSEC provides authentication and integrity checks for DNS data but does not provide confidentialityprotection. All answers from DNSSEC-protected zones are digitally signed. TLS&#x2F;SSL: Client and server negotiate encryption algorithms and session keys. Relies on trust and decisions regarding certificate authorities for key issuance. HTTPS is built on top of TLS&#x2F;SSL, defeating DNS cache poisoning attacks. Countermeasure for Kaminsky DNS Cache Poisoning Attack:b. Use DNSSEC c. Randomize source port numbers Week7A：IDSIntruders: Impersonator: Typically refers to someone who attacks a system from the outside. Insider: Typically refers to someone who attacks a system from within. Covert Operator: Can be either an external or internal attacker. Design Objectives: Detect various types of intrusion behavior. Including known and unknown attacks. Adapt to new attacks or changes in behavior. Real-time detection of intrusion behavior. Efficient analysis of user activity. Timely reporting of suspicious incidents. Ensure accuracy. Minimize false positives and false negatives. IDS Models: Signature-based: Unusual behavior is known. Alerts are generated when activity matches a signature. Anomaly-based: Normal behavior is known. Alerts are generated when activity deviates from normal behavior. Requires more time and processing power. Can produce false positives (normal activity identified as malicious) and false negatives (malicious activityconsidered normal). Threshold Anomaly Detection Statistical Anomaly Detection Heuristic-based: Uses machine learning models of normal behavior. Alerts are generated when the model identifies activity as anomalous. IDS Architecture: Auditor: Records all security-related activities for analysis. Analyzer: Analyzes data from the auditor automatically and updates settings as needed. Notifier: Reports detected anomalies and updates settings as needed, triggers appropriate countermeasures. IDS Types: Host-based IDS (HIDS): Deployed on individual systems to detect malicious activity on a single device. Can also be used in adistributed system within a network. Pros: Lower cost, as most HIDS are software-based; visibility into low-level activities; lower falsepositive rates for local threats. Cons: Limited view of the network; potential for system tampering by malicious insiders. Network-based IDS (NIDS): Monitors network traffic to detect intrusion behavior across the entire network. Pros: Can see attacks in network traffic, particularly at the transport or IP layer; difficult to tamperwith. Cons: May require dedicated hardware; challenging to inspect encrypted traffic. Week7B：Denial of service attackGoals Target on availability take out a large site with little computing work How: amplification DoS bug -&gt; design flaw DoS flood -&gt; command bot-net to generate a flood of requests Will bypass SYN flood protection proxy Mitigation Client puzzles given challenges for TCP connection floods, the first data must contain a puzzle solution, otherwise, the TCP connectionis closed. for SSL handshake DoS Challenge C based on TLS session ID Server: check puzzle solution before RSA decryption Limitations Requires changes to both clients and servers Hurts low-power legitimate clients during an attack CAPTCHAs Applies to application layer DDoS Source identification Ingress filtering identify packet source block the attack at the source ISP only forwards packets with legitimate source IP Source identification Traceback DDoS involves many packets on thes ame path Store one link in each packet Path can be long Countermeasures Prevent initial hack Use of firewalls Check ingress&#x2F;egress packets Use a server farm and load balancer to offset the effects of a DDoS attack Change the IP address of the attacked system Week8：Penetration Testing in PracticeTypes of tests: **Application penetration testing (**typically web applications), which finds technical vulnerabilities Infrastructure penetration testing, which examines servers, firewalls and other hardware for securityvulnerabilities. TIPSMAC Only Authenticity Integrity IEEE 802.11i Security of WPA2 CCMP Authentication: Verifying the identity of users or devices. Confidentiality: Protecting data from being intercepted during transmission by encrypting it. Integrity: Ensuring that data is not tampered with during transmission using checksums and MessageAuthentication Codes (MAC). Transport Layer Security (TLS): Confidentiality: Protecting data from being intercepted during transmission by encrypting it. Integrity: Ensuring that data is not tampered with during transmission using checksums and MessageAuthentication Codes (MAC). Authentication: Verifying the identity of communication parties through methods like digital certificates.","tags":["Monash"]},{"title":"Hello World","path":"/2024/04/19/hello-world/","content":"Welcome to Hexo!
